## Description

### Background

The task was to create a web application that met the following requirerments:

1. Responsive
2. Interactive
3. Built with Bootstrap
4. Use of 2 APIs
5. Persistent local storage

The Health Check App meets all the above requirements

### Health Check App Oveview

1. The App is a 'simple funnel' designed to find people interested in weightloss and fitness products and services

2. The 'hook' used is easy access to 2 basic tools that allow people to measure their overall health via a BMI score and an indication of thier ideal weight

3. Users are then offered a 'lead magnet' which offers a free info product in exchange for their email address

4. Users that provide their email address are then effectively in the funnel

### Future Enhancements

The app is very basic at this stage but can be enhanced in the future by adding the following:

1. More tools such as: Daily calorie requirements, Burned calories from activity, Macro Nutrient amounts and Body Fat percentage

2. More functionality that offer users a choice of settings for height and weight parameters

3. More use of graphical representations to enhance user experience
